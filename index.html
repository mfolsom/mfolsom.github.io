        <h1>What is Space?</h1>
        Space is the area beyond the upper limits of Earth’s atmosphere. It is where all of the asteroids, comets, planets, stars,
        solar systems and galaxies in our universe are found. Space is a vacuum, meaning it contains almost nothing, but
        it is not completely empty. (Source:
